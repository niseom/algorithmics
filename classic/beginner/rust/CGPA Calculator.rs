 * Description: This code implements a CGPA calculator program in Rust, which calculates
 * the Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) of a student based on their exam results.
 * The program uses a Course struct to represent individual courses taken by the student,
 * and a CGPA_Calculator struct to represent the overall performance of the student.
 * The program allows the user to add courses with their respective grades and credit hours,
 * and calculates the overall CGPA based on the formula (total grade points / total credit hours).
 * This implementation is efficient and easy to use, and can be used to calculate the CGPA
 * of any number of courses taken by a student.
